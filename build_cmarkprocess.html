<h1 id="building-a-commonmark-processor-in-denotypescript">Building a
CommonMark Processor in Deno+TypeScript</h1>
<p>By R. S. Doiel, 2025-07-26</p>
<p>CommonMark and Markdown are easier to proof read and edit than HTML.
CommonMark is a super set of John Grubber’s original Markdown. It
incorporates common practices and extensions to the original Markdown.
I’ve found over the years the “Markdown” I type is really “CommonMark”.
I use <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> for processing my
CommonMark documents into HTML. There are a few transforms I’d like to
make before I send the text off to Pandoc. That is what I’ll be
covering.</p>
<p>My CommonMark Processor will be responsible for several things. The
features I miss are simple. Here’s the short list.</p>
<ul>
<li>support <code>@include-code-block</code> for including code samples
as code blocks</li>
<li>support <code>@include-text-block</code> for include plain text into
a CommonMark document</li>
<li>transform Hashtags into front matter</li>
<li>transform web Mentions into front matter</li>
</ul>
<p>My homepage is built from a sequence of plain text files. I also
commonly need to include source code in my blog posts. That has lead me
to think about an include mechanisms. A source file should be included
in a CommonMark code block while plain text can be included as is.</p>
<p>The include blocks, text and code, can also be detected through
regular expression. The difference for those is they require reading
files from disk. That needs to be handled.</p>
<p>Here’s the syntax I’d use for code block and included texts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@include-code-block</code> <code>FILEPATH [LANGUAGE]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@include-text-block</code> <code>FILEPATH</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally I’d to add support for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">Hashtags</a> and web <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mention_(blogging)">Mentions</a>. I
want to explore integrating both with facets in search results, for that
I’ll need to track them in the front matter. Overtime I’ll explore new
features. The <code>commonMarkDoc.ts</code> module needs to be simple to
extend.</p>
<p>How do I extract Hashtags and Mentions? Both are function similar
though are used for different purposes. A regular expression should be
suitable to pick them out. The difference between extracting a Hashtag
or a Mention is the prefix, “#” or “@”. A function that code use the
supplied text and prefix could return a list of tagged results.</p>
<p>I want to easily extend the processor. I can create modules based on
the transforms I need. Each module will include a function that
implements the transform. The <code>process</code> method will be
responsible for sequencing the transforms and updating the CommonMark
object with the results.</p>
<p>What do I need in my CommonMark document object? I need to take the
markup, parse it and have the object holding the CommonMark document
split into front matter and content. Similarly I will need to reassemble
the parts into back into a CommonMark text. Those functions will be
called <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>. These names are
idiomatic in JavaScript and TypeScript. The object type will be called
<code>CommonMarkDoc</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the basic outline of the <code>CommonMarkDoc</code> object
without the <code>process</code> method.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
commonMarkDoc_v1.ts TypeScript</p>
<p>This object makes it easy to work the front matter and the main
content parts of a CommonMark document. The <code>parse</code> and
<code>stringify</code> methods can bookend the <code>process</code>
method implementing the transform sequence. This provides the
functionality needed to implement a CommonMark Processor.</p>
<p>The <code>process</code> method will evolve overtime. I need to
minimize its complexity. The <code>process</code> method is only
responsible for sequencing the transforms defined in their own
modules.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion-mechanisms">Inclusion mechanisms</h2>
<p>Before writing the <code>process</code> method I will work through
the transform modules.</p>
<p>I need two inclusion mechanisms. One will support plain text file
inclusion. The other will wrap the included file in the CommonMark
markup for code blocks. Here’s the syntax I want to use in my CommonMark
document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@include-text-block</code> <code>FILENAME</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@include-code-block</code> <code>FILENAME LANGUAGE</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these will be implemented in their own module. Let’s look at
the one for <code>@include-text-block</code>. Here’s what the include
text module looks like.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
includeTextBlock.ts TypeScript</p>
<p>The public function handles finding the file referenced, reading it
into a string before including it the transformed content block. Let’s
look at the one for <code>@include-code-block</code>.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
includeCodeBlock.ts TypeScript</p>
<p>These modules are very similar. I’ve implemented them as separate
modules because I want the option of evolving them independently. I
don’t want to entangled the two functions unnecessarily. Keeping both
simple in separate modules aligns with that.</p>
<h2 id="hashtags-and-mentions">Hashtags and Mentions</h2>
<p>The other transforms needed in the <code>process</code> method are
extracting the Hashtags and Mentions which will be used to update the
front matter. Both Hashtags and Mentions are similar. They have a
prefix, “#” or “@” followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters,
period and underscores. Trailing periods are stripped. They should be
kept separate in the front matter. Each plays different content
roles.</p>
<p>Collecting tags in the text is easy using a regular expression. I
have to make a choice about the resulting list. One approach would just
be list a tag each time it is encountered. This will result in repeated
tags. That can be problematic. Instead I would like the list of tags
returned to be a unique list. The extraction function will need a
parameter for the source text and the prefix. It should return a list of
unique tags. I’m going to call this function,
<code>extractTags</code>.</p>
<p>As I collect tags I will need an ability to merge the unique tag.
That suggestions a merge function. That function will take one or more
lists of tags and return a single list of unique tags. I’m going to call
these function <code>mergeTags</code>. Both relate to tags and exist
because of extraction. I’ll put them in a module called
<code>extractTags.ts</code>. Here is my implementation.</p>
<p><span class="citation"

extractTags.ts TypeScript</p>
<h2 id="the-process-method">The <code>process</code> method</h2>
<p>I have the set of transforms I want. I will need to sequence them in
the <code>process</code> method. Here is a look at the internals of the
<code>process</code> method.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
process_method.txt TypeScript</p>
<p>To use the the transform functions in the <code>process</code> method
I need to import them.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
import_block.txt TypeScript</p>
<h2 id="the-complete-commonmark-processor-module">The complete
CommonMark processor module</h2>
<p>Here is the complete <code>commonMarkDoc.ts</code> module.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
commonMarkDoc_v2.ts TypeScript</p>
<h2 id="the-commonmark-processor-application">The CommonMark processor
application</h2>
<p>To use this module I need to wrap it so I can execute it from the
command line. My processor is going to be called
<code>cmarkprocess</code> so I’ll name the module that becomes the
command line program is <code>cmarkprocess.ts</code>. This module will
include a “main” function, that function will handle command line
options and parameters as well as read data from either standard input
or a file. It’ll use the <code>CommonMarkDoc</code> <code>process</code>
method and write the results to standard out.</p>
<p><span class="citation"
data-cites="include-code-block">@include-code-block</span>
cmarkprocess.ts TypeScript</p>
<p>Now that we have our wrapping modules, how do I get a nice executable
using Deno?</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>deno compile --allow-read -o bin/cmarkprocess cmarkprocess.ts</code></pre>
<p>The result is an executable, <code>bin/cmarkprocess</code>. This
executable can read from standard input or from a file path. It will
write to standard output.</p>
